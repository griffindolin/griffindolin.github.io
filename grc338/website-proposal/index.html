					<h1> about </h1>
				
					<p> Born from the idea of 1920s style prohibition bars, The Cuts Alley Shop is speakeasy Esq and sits below a fully functioning restaurant and bar.

                        Once inside you will feel welcome in a very traditional style barbershop. Our master barbers and stylists can offer traditional shaves, quality haircuts, and even hot towel treatments. 

                        Our goal is to have our customers leave with the haircut they actually wanted and an experience that they will remember. We want our barbershop to be integrated into the community and not only be a place to get your haircut but a place to talk and hang out as well.
